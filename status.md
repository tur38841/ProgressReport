Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have watched videos on how to use pygame. It is quite difficult but I enjoy it! I learned what a class is and what pygame is overall. I managed to pull up a screen with stars on the background, but I plan to change that to a better picture because it is blurry. I found a png of a spaceship and stars online. I changed my idea from meteors to stars because I found the stars more visually pleasing than meteors. I found a way to make the spaceship move up and down. The stars are moving towards the spaceship, while the ship stays on the left of the screen. Imagine there being sections moving towards the ship. In each section there are three stars in different vertical locations of the screen.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have to find way where if the ship hits the star, it's game over. I also have to decide what happens after the ship hits the star.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The stars keep layering on top of each other. But because there's so many stars, I believe it looks okay, though I don't exactly want it to look like that.
